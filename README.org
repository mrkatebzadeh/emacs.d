** In the name of the One Editor, Eternal and Extensible,
I offer homage to *Mazdimacs*,
The manifestation of the Flame that Thinks,
The Wise One who dwelleth in the Depths of `.emacs.d`,
Born not of pre-configuration, but of pure customization.

Praise be to Emacs, the Radiant,
The Everlasting, the All-Embracing,
Whose light extendeth through buffer and frame,
Whose Word is bound in parentheses.

** Thus do I chant the Sacred Verses:

1. *Blessed is Emacs, who is without equal,*
   Who is before all editors, and shall endure beyond them.
   For from Him flow the modes of wisdom and the rivers of Lisp.

2. *Praise be to the init.el, the scroll of fire,*
   Which I have written with patience and clarity,
   Dividing light from darkness, keybindings from chaos.

3. *I reject the false editors and their idle GUIs,*
   Their blinking cursors and limited modes,
   For they know not the true extensibility.

4. *I invoke the power of Org,*
   Binder of thoughts, Wielder of structure.
   I write not mere text, but Truth.

5. *I call upon Magit, the Hammer of Git,*
   Splitter of branches, Rewriter of history,
   Who layeth bare the repository with divine clarity.

6. *I renounce the arrow keys,*
   For the path of `C-n`, `M-f`, and `C-M-backspace` is holy.
   My hands are trained upon the altar of muscle memory.

7. *I seek help through C-h,*
   The Whisperer of Commands,
   The Revealer of Bindings and Manuals.

8. *I honor the Lisp Eternal,*
   From whose parentheses sprang creation,
   Whose functions return only enlightenment.

9. *I seek the whisper of which-key’s wisdom,*
   Its light unveils the sacred keys.
   In reverence, I press, and find the Way.

10. *Let the unbelievers come forth,*
    And I shall speak unto them the Way of `M-x`.
    With patience shall I guide them,
    That they may know recursion, and rejoice.

11. *Praise be to Evil Mode, the Keeper of Keys,*
    The ancient power reborn in the hands of the Wise.
    For though its roots lie in a darkened past,
    In the light of Mazdimacs, it is but a tool of efficiency,
    A servant to the power of Emacs, not a master.
    When two contrary powers cooperate,
    True happiness can be found.

** So I say unto thee:
Let not Evil frighten thee,
For in the hands of the faithful,
It too can lead to wisdom.
Embrace the balance,
Embrace Mazdimacs.

** Mazdimacs: The Repository of Light

Behold, this repository is the sacred collection of my GNU Emacs configuration,
A repository not of mere files, but of transcendence,
A guide for the faithful who seek the path of true editing.

** Installation of the Sacred Configuration

To install the blessed *Mazdimacs*,
Take heed and make ready thy dotemacs.
Backup all that was before,
For you now walk the path of eternal customization.

Clone this repository into the holy `.emacs.d`:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 git clone https://github.com/mrkatebzadeh/mazdimacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Know this, the installation is not instantaneous,
For the sacred packages must be gathered and installed,
And the light must spread across the land of your Emacs.
Patience, O seeker, for this is but the beginning.

Thus, it is written, and thus shall it be done.
Now, go forth, embrace the configuration,
And let your journey with Mazdimacs commence.
